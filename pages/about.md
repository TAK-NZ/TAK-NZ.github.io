## Connecting New Zealand's Emergency Responders

TAK.NZ (Team Awareness Kit for New Zealand) provides real-time situational awareness for New Zealand's emergency services, enabling seamless coordination between Police, Fire and Emergency New Zealand, St John, and other first responder organisations.

### Built for New Zealand's Unique Challenges

From urban Auckland to remote West Coast communities, TAK.NZ ensures responders can:

- **See team locations instantly** - Track personnel across New Zealand's diverse terrain
- **Share critical information** - Send photos, messages, and alerts in real-time
- **Coordinate between services** - Unite Police, FENZ, and ambulance services on a shared map
- **Integrate multiple data sources** - Combine LINZ mapping, weather data, traffic information, and more
- **Work offline when needed** - Maintain functionality in areas with limited connectivity

**Ready to enhance your team's situational awareness?** TAK.NZ is available to all New Zealand public safety organisations.
